# Squad Vision Skill

This skill produces two types of strategic documents:

1. **Vision Document** — Provides 12-18 month direction on a product domain to align teams and management
2. **Opportunity Assessment** — Evaluates whether a topic merits work with a go/no-go recommendation

## Key Operating Principles

- **No invention**: Mark unknown data as "[À compléter]" rather than fabricating metrics or facts
- **Interactive approach**: Validate document type and assumptions before full drafting through dialogue
- **Expert coaching**: Challenge assumptions and identify blind spots while clarifying thinking

## Process Flow

1. Load squad context from `references/squad-context.md` to enrich documents with OKRs and constraints
2. Collect missing information through targeted questions (2-3 priority questions first, not all at once)
3. Draft using appropriate templates with factual content and explicit OKR linkage
4. Propose next steps including validation owners and concrete actions

## When to Use Each Format

Choose **Vision Document** for long-term direction alignment across a domain. Select **Opportunity Assessment** when deciding whether to prioritize a specific topic with a clear recommendation.
