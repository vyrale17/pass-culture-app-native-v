# OKR Coach

This skill helps teams draft, review, and improve Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)—a goal-setting framework combining qualitative objectives with quantitative key results.

## Key Collaboration Rules
1. **No Invention** — Request baselines rather than assume them; mark unknowns as `[baseline à confirmer]`
2. **Interactive Approach** — Present diagnostic first, validate direction together before rewriting
3. **Expert Coaching** — Challenge ambition levels and strategic alignment; think together, not just reformulate

## OKR Fundamentals
- **Objectives:** Qualitative, inspirational, quarterly goals
- **Key Results:** Quantitative, measurable outcomes (3-5 per objective)
- **Success Target:** ~70% confidence of achievement

## When to Use
- Quarterly OKR drafting
- Team OKR review and management
- Training on effective OKRs
- Converting vague goals into measurable results

## Required Input
Either draft OKRs for review OR goals to convert into OKRs. Helpful additions: company/team OKRs, current metrics, strategic context.

## Process Overview
The skill follows five steps: check context files, understand input, score each OKR, flag common mistakes, and provide rewrites with baselines and rationale.

## Scoring Criteria
Each OKR is assessed on ambition, measurability, alignment, and clarity using 1-5 scales.

## Common Mistakes Identified
- Outputs vs. outcomes confusion
- Activities vs. results
- Excessive KRs per objective
- Binary vs. measurable targets
- Missing baselines
- Subjective qualifiers

## Framework Reference
Based on John Doerr's *Measure What Matters*, with success scored 0.0-1.0 (0.7 = target).
